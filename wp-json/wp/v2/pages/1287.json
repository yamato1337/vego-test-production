To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original packaging. Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of purchase.<\/p><p>Please note your purchase can not be returned if you have opened it, unless you can prove it was compromised before you opened it by supplying photographs to us within 24hrs of delivery.<\/p><p><b>Refunds<\/b><\/p><p>We want you and your companion to enjoy Benevo pet food, however sometimes tings don&#8217;t always go to plan.<br \/>When it does go wrong, please contact us so we can help resolve your issue.<\/p><p>Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item. If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer&#8217;s policies.<\/p><p>There are occasions where a refund is appropriate and some where a refund is not possible.<\/p><p><strong>Refunds<\/strong><br \/>Refunds are not possible when:<br \/><strong>1. Your companion doesn&#8217;t like the food<\/strong> &#8211; It doesn&#8217;t happen very often, so be sure to follow the 10-14 day transition guide. You can also try moistening the food slightly or adding their favourite topping to help with the transition. If in doubt you can order small sample packs from our shop.<br \/><strong>2. The food has not been kept cool and dry<\/strong> &#8211; Cool and dry means storing it away from sunlight, heat, and moisture at a temperature of less than 22&#8217;C\/77&#8217;F. Warm, humid conditions will cause the oil in the food to oxidise which smell a bit like paint and raised moisture can give way to mould growing. This is typical of most foods and can happen in just a couple of days storing it the wrong way.<br \/>If the food has either of these two issues on arrival, please report it with 24 hrs. The longer the period from receiving it to reporting it, the less chance there is we can refund the item.<\/p><p>Acceptable reasons for a refund:<br \/><strong>1. Arrived damaged<\/strong> &#8211; Only new and checked products are ever sent but occasionally delivery companies damage the goods in transit. Where damage has resulted in the food being is exposed and it is reported with a photo within 24hrs, we will arrange a refund. The photo is required for our claim against the delivery company.<br \/><strong>2. Ordered the wrong product<\/strong> &#8211; If by accident you have ordered the wrong product, you will need to return the item unopened at your expense. Once we receive and check the item is saleable, we can arrange the refund minus the original delivery cost (if any).<br \/><strong>3. Received the wrong product<\/strong> &#8211; If we have sent the wrong item, please contact us to arrange collection and replacement or a refund if you no longer require the item. The product must remain unopened to qualify for a refund.<br \/><strong>4. Return the products unopened<\/strong> &#8211; If your plans have changed, we understand that. In this case you are responsible for returning the goods in a saleable condition. Once received and checked we can issue the refund minus the cost of the original delivery (if any).<br \/><strong>5.
