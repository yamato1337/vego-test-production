Registered in England &amp; Wales Company No. 5896605.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">We aim for total customer satisfaction. If you have any suggestions or comments please contact us using the details below:<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Our Contact details:<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Benevo<br \/>c\/o Vegeco Ltd,\u00a0<br \/>Unit 4 Downley Business Park,<br \/>Downley Road,<br \/>Havant,\u00a0<br \/>Hampshire<br \/>PO9 2NJ\u00a0<br \/>United Kingdom<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Email: customerservices @ benevo.com<\/p><p class=\"p1\">VAT Registration No. 889 5507 58\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Making a Purchase<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Making a purchase could not be easier. Just browse our store, and add any items that you wish to buy into the shopping basket. After you have finished your selection, click on &#8216;Checkout&#8217; and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to complete the order.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">We accept payment by credit and debit card.\u00a0<br \/>We can not take payment via cheque or cash, sorry.<br \/>Currently we can only post orders within the UK.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">When a confirmation order email is sent to you, this is to indicate that we have received your order. It does not indicate that a contract exists between us.\u00a0<br \/>All orders placed by you and purchases of goods from us (whether in-store, by telephone, via our website or by such other means as we may permit) are on the basis of these Terms and Conditions and are subject to acceptance by us either (as applicable): (i) by delivery of the goods to you; or (ii) by providing the goods you have purchased to you at our premises, at which point a legally binding contract is constituted between you and us.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">We have included this term to protect us in the case that a mistake has been made in pricing, we have inadvertently under-priced goods, or we are no longer able to supply a particular product for some reason. In the case of a change of price, we will always contact you first to ensure that the price is acceptable.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>&#8216;Best Before&#8217; &amp; &#8216;Use By&#8217; Dates<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Firstly, it important to point out that these two terms are often confused or used interchangeably, however they mean two very different things:<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>&#8216;Best Before&#8217;<\/strong> relates to <strong>quality<\/strong> &#8211; taste and appearance may change.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>&#8216;Use By&#8217;<\/strong> relates to <strong>safety<\/strong> &#8211; the risk that the product may spoil.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">&#8216;Best Before&#8217; dates are arbitrary dates that are only a suggestion of when a product will be in its ideal condition &#8211; they do not suddenly become unusable, inedible or even dangerous at that point in time &#8211; they are simply at their &#8216;best&#8217; before these dates. Beyond the &#8216;Best Before&#8217; date the character of the goods may gradually become affected by their storage condition, possibly changing the taste or the colour of the items. And some nutritional levels may fall below the levels stated on the pack. However, in our experience drops in quality normally happen months after such dates. Most products we handle have very long best before dates. Goods will have a long enough best before date to consume the goods based on your parcel delivery date.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\">&#8216;Use By&#8217; dates are different, it is not recommended that you use those products after that date. Again, they may not be a problem, but they are likely to spoil.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Bulk Orders<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">If you intend to order a large amount of one item, we strongly advise you to contact us to check if the &#8216;Best Before&#8217; or &#8216;Use By&#8217; dates are suitable, especially if you do not expect to consume them all immediately. We normally have very good dates on most products, but as an example if you buy 10 identical items that you intend to use just once a month &#8211; you may be disappointed if we have stock with a BBE date of 5 months.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Delivery Schedule<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Orders that have been paid for online will be prepared immediately.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\">If you know you are unlikely to be in at the time of delivery, you may provide an alternative delivery address in the checkout, which allows many customers to receive orders at work, or via friends and family.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Orders that arrive late or are returned to us as a result of incorrect delivery details or no one being present at the address at the time of delivery will not receive a refund for goods that as a result then become unsuitable for consumption. Nor will we accept costs incurred in collecting your order from an alternative address as a result of no one being present at the delivery address or incorrect delivery information. Orders returned to us will not receive a refund for postage and should you still require the order, postage is charged again. Some couriers will leave parcels without signatures but please assume in all cases, that a signature is required. So if you&#8217;re at work during the day and there&#8217;s no one at home, perhaps your work address would be better, or a relative or neighbour.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">You accept the delivery company have the right to leave your parcel at a local post office or return it to the depot for collection if you are not in to receive the goods.<br \/>Most couriers will send you details of your estimated delivery time and various other options. Please make sure you provide a mobile number and email during checkout for the courier to communicate directly with you.<br \/>Please note couriers will typically GPS track where parcels are left, photograph them and\/or leave a delivery note as part of their service, however they are a 3rd party company and any problems caused by them are out of our control and do not warrant a refund.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Offline Payment<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Orders that are not paid for at the time of making them online will be held but not processed until payment is made. It does not reserve the goods you would like, so prompt payment is essential. If you do not contact us within 4 days we may cancel the order and make the items available to other customers again. Please use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benevo.com\/2021\/2021\/contact-benevo\/\">contact<\/a> form in the footer if you have placed an order without successfully completing checkout.<br \/>Goods will not be dispatched until full payment is received so please ensure you send the correct total amount including applicable delivery costs.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">You agree that the \u2018Service\u2019 we provide begins once the order is received by us and paid for. Your order is prepared, picked, packed and dispatched all before you receive it. The \u2018Service\u2019 as defined in this sense begins from the time we commence this work, not when the parcel is dispatched, nor when it is received. Although stock levels are regularly checked, stock levels on the site are just an indication but may on occasions not reflect actual levels due to the nature of some items which are more perishable for example.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">You agree that we may use your full contact details in order to assist with delivery. For example: including your telephone number on the delivery address label.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">You agree that in line with UK legislation we have a maximum of 30 days in which to fulfil your order. Additionally, in the rare event that delivery may be delayed due to the actions or errors of a delivery company that you will allow us reasonable opportunity to intervene and ensure the goods are delivered to you.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Delivery schedules are generally reliable (more so with couriers) but can not be guaranteed. Difficulties in the postal system, especially in the events of strikes or adverse weather are beyond our control, Therefore late delivery is not reason alone for a refund. If you believe your order may be late, do not hesitate to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benevo.com\/2021\/2021\/contact-benevo\/\">contact<\/a> us as you will most likely know, before we will, if a problem is developing.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Tax Charges<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">In accordance with legislation, VAT is charged is charged at 20% on applicable goods and services regardless of where the customer is buying from. Tax is charged at source, which is the United Kingdom.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Importing Goods into Countries Outside the UK<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">If we have agreed to export goods outside the UK to you, then you accept that you are entirely responsible for import paperwork, charges, duties and taxes due on the goods you are importing. You must check with your customs department to make sure you satisfy their requirements before buying and the you fully understand the responsibilities and liabilities you will have for the goods you are importing. If you require specific information or paperwork, you must contact us before buying the goods with your requirements.<br \/>Returned goods will be dealt with in the same way as other orders. Refunds being dependent on who is at fault and the quality of goods returned.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Credit Card Security<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">This website is operated by Vegeco Ltd.

We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item. If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund (subject to deductions) to your credit card (or original method of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer\u2019s policies.<\/p><p>There are occasions where a refund is appropriate and some where a refund is not possible.<\/p><p><strong>Refunds<\/strong><br \/>Refunds are not possible when:<br \/><strong>1. Your companion doesn\u2019t like the food<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 It doesn\u2019t happen very often, so be sure to follow the 10-14 day transition guide. You can also try moistening the food slightly or adding their favourite topping to help with the transition. If in doubt you can order small sample packs from our shop.<br \/><strong>2. The food has not been kept cool and dry<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Cool and dry means storing it away from sunlight, heat, and moisture at a temperature of less than 22\u2019C\/77\u2019F. Warm, humid conditions will cause the oil in the food to oxidise which smell a bit like paint and raised moisture can give way to mould growing. This is typical of most foods and can happen in just a couple of days storing it the wrong way.<br \/>If the food has either of these two issues on arrival, please report it with 24 hrs. The longer the period from receiving it to reporting it, the less chance there is we can refund the item.<\/p><p>Acceptable reasons for a refund:<br \/><strong>1. Arrived damaged<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Only new and checked products are ever sent but occasionally delivery companies damage the goods in transit. Where damage has resulted in the food being is exposed and it is reported with a photo within 24hrs, we will arrange a refund. The photo is required for our claim against the delivery company.<br \/><strong>2. Ordered the wrong product<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 If by accident you have ordered the wrong product, you will need to return the item unopened at your expense. Once we receive and check the item is saleable, we can arrange the refund minus the original delivery cost (if any).<br \/><strong>3. Received the wrong product<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 If we have sent the wrong item, please contact us to arrange collection and replacement or a refund if you no longer require the item. The product must remain unopened to qualify for a refund.<br \/><strong>4. Return the products unopened<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 If your plans have changed, we understand that. In this case you are responsible for returning the goods in a saleable condition. Once received and checked we can issue the refund minus the cost of the original delivery (if any).<br \/><strong>5. Other<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 If your reason for a return\/refund request is not listed above choose this option to open a discussion with our team.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Website Terms and Conditions of Use<\/b><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Please read this agreement carefully before accessing or using this site.
